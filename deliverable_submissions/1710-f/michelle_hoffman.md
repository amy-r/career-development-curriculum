## Mod 2 Deliverables

### Written reflection:
#### How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:

1. What were you already doing?
   Working in phases for projects is very similar to utilizing an agile process. 
2. What did you put into place in Module Two?
   I had to add a few steps since the project specs were a lot more vague. For some projects, I had to plan the phases and designs on my own. 
3. What was effective?
   It's been effective to work in phases of small features. 
4. What do you want to improve on in future projects?
   I would like to start tackling projects right away rather than waiting a day. I hope with better momentum at the beginning of a project, I will not have to stress so much closer to the deadline.
5. Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
   I used my strengths of focus and restorative to make sure that my partners and I stayed on track with troubleshooting issues and hitting all of the project specs.
